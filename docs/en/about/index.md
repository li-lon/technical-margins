# About me

Hello and welcome! I'm Lise P., a technical writer documenting business management software for a French company. Beyond simply conveying technical information, what drives me is the search for innovative ways to make information more accessible and intuitive for users.

My journey has been somewhat unconventional â€“ like that of many technical writers. I began in the academic world, studying Asian languages and cultures and working in literary translation, before finding my path in technical documentation. This shift allowed me to bring together my interest in technology with my linguistic skills. Today, this dual expertise informs my approach to documentation, blending methodological precision with a touch of creativity.

With *Technical Margins*, I share my reflections on the edges of documentation, where the formal gives way to a freer space for thought and exploration. A style quite different from my technical documentation, I assure you. Here, I uncover ideas, inspirations, and paths less travelled. Please feel free to reach out and join the conversation, for in the margins, there is always room for new discoveries.
