# About me

Hello! If you've found your way to this page, perhaps a little introduction is in order. I'm a technical writer at a French company, documenting professional software for logistics management. My work primarily involves making complex information clearer and more accessible for users of our solutions. Beyond simply delivering technical content, I'm driven by a search for innovative ways to make information easier to access, intuitive, and simple to grasp.

My background is somewhat unconventional – but in technical writing, isn't that often the case? My path began with a focus on languages, Asian cultures, and literary translation, which led me from academic research to technical documentation. This shift allowed me to combine my interest in technology with my linguistic skills. Today, this dual expertise shapes my approach to documentation, blending methodological rigour with a touch of creativity.

With *Technical Margins*, I take on a few technical explorations and share reflections on the margins of documentation, where formality gives way to thought and freer writing. A style quite distinct from my technical documentation, I assure you! In these margins, I explore ideas, inspirations, and paths a little off the beaten track. Feel free to join the conversation if you're so inclined – the margins are a space for shared discoveries.
