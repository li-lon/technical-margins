# **Welcome to *Technical Margins***

*Technical Margins* is, above all, a space for technical experimentation where I plan to explore the features of various static site generators, starting with the blogging plugin of MkDocs' Material theme, and its multilingual capabilities. This project also offers an opportunity for me to become more familiar with GitHub, a platform similar to but distinct from those I use in my work.

While this blog is publicly accessible, it's meant less as a reading space and more as a test environment. That said, it may also offer an opportunity to enrich my technical writing practice through more reflective and creative explorations. Through *Technical Margins*, I'll occasionally share thoughts on documentation engineering, user experience, and how creativity can inspire our approach to user support.

Ultimately, this endeavour serves as a way to refresh my skills while nurturing inspiration through writing and other creative pursuits â€“ a drive that will, in turn, support my professional commitment.
