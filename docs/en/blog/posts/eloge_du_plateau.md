# Breaking Free from Performance: An Ode to the Musical Plateau

## Please Let My Hobby Be üêù 

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been playing guitar for ages; you must be a virtuoso by now! Play us something?‚Äù How many times have I heard these words, laden with expectations? In our society, hungry for performance, music seems bound by a double imperative: technical excellence and spectacle. In French, ‚Äúperformance‚Äù resonates with reaching a high standard, whereas in English, it gravitates towards the stage and the show. And here I am, caught between these two interpretations ‚Äî perhaps fittingly, as it seems we expect musicians, even amateurs, to be flawlessly skilled and ever ready to perform.

But isn‚Äôt there another way to live through music, a more intimate, freer way?

## The Double Tyranny of Performance

Imagine this same logic of performance applied to other passions. Would we say to a friend who devours books, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been reading for so long; you must have written a novel by now?‚Äù Or to someone who loves drawing, ‚ÄúWith all that time spent, when‚Äôs your exhibition?‚Äù True, these might not seem so strange, and could well be said as banter. But let‚Äôs try with a bit more conviction: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been playing on the PS4 for years; you‚Äôre surely ready for e-sports competitions now?‚Äù

When it comes to music, this double pressure of performance ‚Äî both as achievement and as spectacle ‚Äî seems inescapable. It seeps in, turning what should be a space of freedom into another field of ‚Äúwork,‚Äù yet another extension of the continuous improvement efforts we typically reserve for our professional lives. While our days are already shaped around the pursuit of ‚Äúbetter and better,‚Äù shouldn‚Äôt our hobbies remain sanctuaries, free from this relentless pressure to excel?

## The Freedom of the Plateau

What if we shifted perspective?

In learning, we often speak of the ‚Äúplateau‚Äù as a phase where, despite regular practice, progress appears to stagnate. ‚ÄúPush past the plateau!‚Äù enjoin the training gurus on YouTube, whether about learning languages or music. But instead of viewing the plateau as an obstacle, why not see it as a place to inhabit?

Picture vast plains: elevated yet calm, gently undulating at most, inviting contemplation rather than ceaseless climbing. The musical plateau could become that space where we exist without pressure, without striving ever higher. Just being there, exploring, with no goal beyond the moment itself. Isn‚Äôt that liberating?

## A Living Space for Exploration

On the plateau, playing becomes a meditative experience. Rather than aiming for perfection, you could improvise over a backing track, letting your fingers wander, enjoying the notes that just feel right ‚Äî or even not quite right, but so what? Here, a misplaced note is neither good nor bad; it simply fades into the moment, free of judgement. It‚Äôs no longer work, but an intimate encounter with the instrument, each note alive in the present.

Similarly, reading tabs can become an exploration without expectation. No need to memorise every part; you can savour each chord, each melody, simply for the pleasure of recreating it, even roughly. No perfection required, just the pure joy of the experience.

## A Private Refuge

Practising ‚Äúon the plateau‚Äù becomes a true refuge ‚Äî not only from the pressure of performance, but from the stress and demands of everyday life. It‚Äôs a space to simply be, with no need to prove, measure one‚Äôs worth, or show progression. Music becomes a way to recharge, a necessary counterpoint to activities focused on results.

## A Quiet Act of Resistance

Keeping this ‚Äúplateau‚Äù approach to music becomes an act of resistance against society‚Äôs push to turn every activity into an optimised performance. It‚Äôs a way of saying that it is possible ‚Äî and necessary ‚Äî to keep spaces in our lives where the constant pursuit of improvement has no place.

By shielding our hobbies from this pressure, we allow our efforts to be spent where they‚Äôre truly needed. Isn‚Äôt that a form of wisdom? So let‚Äôs reclaim our plateaux, these sanctuaries where only the flavour of the moment matters, where exploration outweighs mastery, and where solitude becomes a creative force. In a world entranced by progress and performance, choosing the plateau becomes an act of freedom.

What if we dared to see our hobbies differently?
