# Breaking Free from Performance: An Ode to the Musical Plateau

## Please Let My Hobby Be 🐝 

“You’ve been playing guitar for ages now; you must be a virtuoso! Play us something?” How many times have I heard these words, laced with expectations? In our society, so thirsty for performance, music seems trapped by a double demand: technical excellence and the show. In French, “performance” resonates with the idea of achieving a high standard; in English, it leans more towards the stage and spectacle. And here I am, finding myself blending these meanings — perhaps rightly so, as it seems every musician, even an amateur, is expected to master their art and put on a show.

But isn’t there another way to live through music, one that’s more intimate, more free?

## The Double Tyranny of Performance

Imagine applying this same performance logic to other passions. Would we say to a friend who devours books, “You’ve been reading for so long; you must have written a novel by now, surely?” Or to someone who loves to draw, “With all that time, when’s your exhibition?” Why not, “You’ve been playing on your PS5 for years now — surely you’re entering e-sports tournaments?”

When it comes to music, this dual pressure of performance—in the sense of results and in the sense of putting on a show—seems inevitable.

When it comes to music, this double pressure of performance — in the sense of achievement and of putting on a show — seems inescapable. It creeps in, turning what ought to be a realm of freedom into yet another sphere of “work,” another extension of the continuous improvement efforts we already reserve for our professional lives. While our days are filled with a pursuit of “ever better,” shouldn’t our hobbies remain havens, protected from the relentless pressure to excel?

## The Freedom of the Plateau

What if we shifted perspective? In learning, we often speak of the “plateau” as a phase where, despite steady practice, progress seems to stall. But rather than seeing the plateau as an obstacle, why not embrace it as a place to inhabit?

Picture vast plains: elevated yet calm, inviting contemplation rather than relentless climbing. The musical plateau could be that space where you can simply exist, unhurried, not straining to reach the next peak. Just to be there, to explore, with no goal beyond the moment itself. Isn’t that freeing?

## A Living Space for Exploration

could improvise along with a backing track, letting your fingers and ear wander, savouring those notes that just feel right — or perhaps not quite right, but who cares? Here, a misplaced note is neither good nor bad; it fades away into the moment, free of judgement. It’s no longer “working” but an intimate encounter with the instrument, each note coming to life in the present.

Likewise, reading tablature becomes an exploration without pressure. No need to memorise every part; each chord, each melody, can be enjoyed purely for the joy of recreating it, however imperfectly. No demand for perfection, only the raw joy of the experience.

## A Private Refuge

To practice “on the plateau” becomes a true refuge — not only from performance pressure but from the stress and demands of everyday life. It’s a space to simply be, with no need to prove, to measure your worth, or to demonstrate progress. Music becomes a form of renewal, a necessary counterbalance to activities that focus on results.

## A Quiet Act of Resistance

Keeping this “plateau” approach to music becomes an act of resistance against society’s push to turn every activity into an optimised performance. It’s an affirmation that it is possible — and necessary — to keep spaces in our lives where the drive to improve has no place.

By safeguarding our hobbies from this pressure, we free our energies for where they’re truly needed. Isn’t that a form of wisdom? So let’s reclaim our plateaux, these sanctuaries where only the flavour of the moment matters, where exploration is more precious than mastery, and where solitude becomes a creative force. In a world enamoured with progress and performance, consciously choosing the plateau is a liberating act.

What if we dared to see music differently?
